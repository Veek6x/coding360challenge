## Overview

- This was a fun challenge to do from [Codingossy](https://twitter.com/codingossy?s=20&t=Hl3loKv0VUkhox3lLLpWRw). I personally enjoyed this one.

### The challenge

- The challenge was to replicate a website from scratch using any framework of your choice, making it responsive, structured, having clean codes, and also using modern semantics with HTML.

## My process

- I started by downloading all image files needed for the website, then i made a mock-up sketch of how i want it to be. Then i started to code/design first for mobile and then worked my way up for larger screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid System
- CSS Flex System
- jQuery
- Bootsrap
- AOS animations

### What I learned

I learned of a faster and effecient way of getting animations done.

### Useful resources

- [For the slide-in-animations with AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) - I find this to be really helpful in achieving the sleek animations i pulled off on this site
